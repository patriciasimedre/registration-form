# Registration Form

This project is a simple **User Registration Form** built with HTML, CSS, and PHP. It allows users to enter personal details and preferences, which are then saved to a file on the server for later use.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The form is styled with CSS to be user-friendly and works well on various screen sizes.
- **Form Validation**: Required fields are validated to ensure users provide essential information.
- **File Saving**: User responses are saved to a text file (`submissions.txt`) on the server.
- **Confirmation Page**: Users are redirected to a thank-you page upon successful form submission.

## Project Structure

- **`registration_form.html`**: Contains the HTML form that users fill out, including fields for name, email, age, experience level, device preference, and testing interests.
- **`style.css`**: Styles the form, making it visually appealing and ensuring it is responsive across devices.
- **`registration_form.php`**: Processes the form data. Retrieves the data, sanitizes it, and appends it to a text file (`submissions.txt`). If the form submission is successful, it redirects users to a thank-you page.
- **`thank_you.html`**: Displays a confirmation message after successful form submission.
- **`submissions.txt`**: Stores form responses from users.

## Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites

- A server environment that supports PHP (such as XAMPP, WAMP, or a web server with PHP installed).

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
3. **Place the project in a server environment:**:
   - If using a local server, place the files in the appropriate directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP or `www` for WAMP).

4. **Run the form**:
   - Access `registration_form.html` through your local server or hosting environment by navigating to `http://localhost/your-repo-name/registration_form.html`.

5. **Submit the Form**:
   - Fill out the fields in the form and submit. If successful, responses will be saved to `submissions.txt`, and you’ll be redirected to `thank_you.html`.

## Code Explanation

- **HTML Form** (`registration_form.html`): Provides input fields and options for users to enter their information. Key elements include:
  - **Name** and **Email** fields for basic user information.
  - **Age** field (optional) to capture the user's age.
  - **Experience Level** dropdown for selecting the user's UX/UI experience.
  - **Device Preference** radio buttons for selecting the preferred testing device.
  - **Interests** checkboxes to allow users to specify areas of interest in product testing.
  - **Suggestions Textarea** for users to provide additional feedback or suggestions.

- **CSS Styling** (`style.css`): Styles the form elements to create a clean, professional look that is responsive across devices. It includes:
  - Background colors and font styling to enhance readability.
  - Padding and margins for better spacing and layout.
  - Button styling for consistent user interaction.

- **PHP Processing** (`registration_form.php`):
  - **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Ensures that the data received from the form is safe and removes any potentially harmful code.
  - **File Writing**: Opens `submissions.txt` in append mode to save each submission as a new entry without overwriting previous submissions.
  - **Redirection**: Upon successful form submission, the user is redirected to the `thank_you.html` page.

- **Thank-You Page** (`thank_you.html`): Displays a confirmation message to the user, acknowledging that their information has been successfully recorded.

- **Data Storage** (`submissions.txt`): Stores each user's form data, including their name, email, age, experience level, preferred device, interests, and suggestions. Each entry is saved as a new record, allowing you to maintain a history of all form submissions.
